**Overview:**
Hosting a static website on AWS S3 using Terraform provides an automated and efficient way to deploy and manage your web content. This project leverages Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, to create and configure AWS S3 buckets for hosting static website files.

**Key Components:**
AWS S3 Bucket:

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used to store website files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The S3 bucket is configured to serve static content and can be accessed via a web endpoint.

Terraform:

Terraform allows for the automation of infrastructure provisioning. Using Terraform scripts, you can define and manage your S3 bucket configurations and website deployment.

It ensures consistency, version control, and scalability in managing your infrastructure.


**Benefits**:

Automation: Automate the setup and configuration of your hosting environment.

Scalability: Easily scale your infrastructure to accommodate more traffic or additional resources.

Cost-Effective: Hosting a static website on S3 is cost-efficient, as you pay only for the storage and data transfer used.

Resilience: Leverage AWSâ€™s robust infrastructure for high availability and reliability.
